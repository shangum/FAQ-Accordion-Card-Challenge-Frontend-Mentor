## My process

### Built with

- HTML
- CSS
- Sass
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- JavaScript
- [jQuery](https://jquery.com/) - JS library


### What I learned

1) How to use css to rotate images: Initially I was looking for the "up arrow" icon in the challenges resource (I'm use to icon packs like font awesome so I was spoiled). I eventually found out that I would have to figure out how to flip the provided image based on the accordian state. During this challenge I discovered the "transform" css rule which I used to rotate the the icon. Very cool trick which I will definetly used in the future.

2) How to have images extend beyond their parent element: It was good getting familiar with this design style. I've never worked on a design like this and it was good practice handling overflows and working with negative margins.

3) Positioning background images of elements: It was a bit tricky figuring out how to get the background image to line up with the main images above. During this project I became more familiar with the background-position css rule.

4) Sass: I have been continuing to become more familiar with adding Sass to my workflow. Using Sass has been helping me in my journey to use responsive units mainly in my projects.


### Continued development

In the future I want to continue to use Sass and explore more of the advanced functionality.
